# project_Melbourne_rentals
a small project studying melbourne rentals
i will start with scrapying data from realestate.com.au
this website actually has an API, but you need to call and register.
As an individual who's having fun just playing, I don't think they will give it to me. So I just practicing my web scrapying skills here.
